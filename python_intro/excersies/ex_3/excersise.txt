Write a function that takes a list of python dictionaries in to an html table.

(Html table specification: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_tables.htm).


The table should include headers which corresponds to the keys in the dictionary.

We also pass a list of the headers in the correct order to the function.

We can assume that all the keys in the header is in each dictionary.
(As an extension you can try to extend the code to deal with non-existent keys)

We want to produce an output like this:

"<table> <tr> <th> a </th> <th> b </th> </tr><tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> 4 </td></tr> </table>"

from a list of python dictionariers: lists = [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a":3, "b": 4}]

The beginings of the function is in ex_3.py
